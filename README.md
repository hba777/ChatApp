# ChatApp
I made a ChatApp using the FireBase Database.

It was my First Project and I decided to use the FirebBase Databse. I was unfamiliar with the database so I had to research a lot 
to get used to how to integrate everything with the app but at the end it all worked out and it was extremely worth it.

**Features**
1.It uses JetPack Compose and ViewModels.
2.You can chat to other authorized users in real time.

**Missing Features**
1.I couldn't get the profile pictures to work despite trying everything.
2.Friends: Right now you can talk to everyone who has been authenticated.
